# bingo app

## biggest challenges

- actually remembering react
- finding a lightweight way to determine wins
- forcing perfect squares in the grid layout

## shortcomings

the app is not perfect at this point. due to time constraints I haven't fully figured out the following parts

- the responsiveness is not truly smart
- no accessability features added
- color contrasts might be inferior
- i'm sure there's ways to shorten the code

## what i'm happy about

- got inspired by an art show and channeled that inspiration into the design
- the app works.
